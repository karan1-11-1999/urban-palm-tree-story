There was a kid named Bruce Wayne. His parents died when he was young and then his butler took care of him. And after years of training in martial arts, karate, gym etc., he became Batman.
Batman's first super villian that he faced off against was Doctor Death. Doctor Death developed a plan to use poison to extort money from the wealthy. He was going to use this plan to become the richest man in the whole world. Batman had to stop Doctor Death before he began his killing spree. he had to think of a plan fast because he heard Doctor Death was planning to start his killing spree soon.
Batman began to plan his grand attempt at stopping Doctor Death. He decided that he would first break into Doctor Death's laboratory and search for the poison that Doctor Death was gonig to use. He would then try to destroy all of the poison and set a trap for the evil doctor. Batman would need some help, though. Doctor Life wasn't too far away, so Batman hopped in his Batmobile to seek out Doctor Life.

Doctor life gave Batman a bottle of mysterious potion, told him that after drinking the potion, he would have 10 minutes of King Kong's body, and told him to make good use of the 10 minutes. Once he was poisoned by doctor death, maybe even the wealth of the Wayne family would be threatened.Batman took the medicine, jumped on the bat car and drive to Doctor Death's laboratory.
And finally batman fought a lot with doctor death.Batman blew an upper cut to his chin and he became unconsious. So batman had his victory and saved the city once again.
